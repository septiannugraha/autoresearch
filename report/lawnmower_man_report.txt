The Lawnmower Man is a 1992 science fiction dark horror film directed by Brett Leonard, written by Leonard and Gimel Everett, and starring Jeff Fahey as Jobe Smith, a simple man who becomes a genius after undergoing a series of experiments. The film is loosely based on a Stephen King short story of the same name. The Lawnmower Man was one of the first films to explore the concept of virtual reality and its potential effects on the human mind. The film was a commercial success and spawned a sequel, Lawnmower Man 2: Beyond Cyberspace, in 1996.

My report on the Lawnmower Man movie is witty, humorous but concise. The movie is a classic example of science fiction horror and explores the concept of virtual reality in a unique and interesting way. The film is well-directed and well-acted, with Jeff Fahey delivering a standout performance as Jobe Smith. The special effects are also impressive, especially considering the film was made in 1992. Overall, the Lawnmower Man is a must-see for fans of science fiction and horror movies.
