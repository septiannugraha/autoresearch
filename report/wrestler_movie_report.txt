The Wrestler is a 2008 movie directed by Darren Aronofsky and starring Mickey Rourke as Randy "The Ram" Robinson, an aging wrestler who is long past his prime but still ready and rarin' to go on the pro-wrestling circuit. After a particularly brutal beating, however, Randy hangs up his tights, pursues a serious relationship with a long-in-the-tooth stripper (Marisa Tomei), and tries to reconnect with his estranged daughter (Evan Rachel Wood). But he can't resist the lure of the ring and readies himself for a comeback.

The movie is a poignant and powerful exploration of the world of professional wrestling, and the toll that it takes on the bodies and minds of those who participate in it. Rourke's performance as Randy is nothing short of incredible, and he brings a depth and complexity to the character that is truly remarkable. Tomei and Wood are also excellent in their roles, and the chemistry between the three actors is palpable.

Overall, The Wrestler is a must-see movie for anyone who is a fan of professional wrestling, or who is interested in exploring the darker side of the human psyche. It is a powerful and moving film that will stay with you long after the credits have rolled.
